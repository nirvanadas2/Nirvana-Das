<p >
I am currently a 2nd year student pursuing <strong>BTech</strong> in <strong>CSE Core</strong>.
The experience so far has been incredibly enriching and transformative.
I loved learning all the programming languages such as <b><i>python, c++, java, etc</i></b>.
These skills have given me the abil8ty to create solutions and think logically about problems, a quality that i believe will help me thrive in the technology driven world.

They are both engineers and have motivated to pursue this career.
