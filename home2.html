      My name is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nirvana Das</span>. I am from <strong>Mumbai</strong>, famously known as <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">the city of dreams</span>.
      Growing up in such a bustling and vibrant city has shaped me into a creative and passionate individual.
      I have developed hobbies such as <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">painting, reading books, and swimming</span> which bring me immense joy and help me balance my daily life.
      I love eating <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">butter chicken, pizza, and sushi</span>.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      I am currently a 2nd year student pursuing <strong>BTech</strong> in <strong>CSE Core</strong>.
      The experience so far has been incredibly enriching and transformative.
      I loved learning all the programming languages such as <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">python, c++, java, etc.</span>
      These skills have given me the ability to create solutions and think logically about problems, a quality that I believe will help me thrive in the technology-driven world.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      My <span style="font-weight: bold;">mother and father</span> are a constant pillar of support.
      They are both engineers and have motivated me to pursue this career.
      My parents have taught me the value of <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">education, discipline, and success</span> in the field and have encouraged me to dream big and work towards achieving my goals.
      My <span style="font-weight: bold;">sister</span> is 13 years old and she is very fun and lively.
