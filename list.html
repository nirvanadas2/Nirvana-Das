<h1>Reviews of my favourite movies</h1>

<dt><b>1.Interstellar</b></dt>
<dd> Genre: Sci-Fi/Thriller
Christopher Nolan’s Inception is a mind-bending cinematic masterpiece that challenges audiences to question the nature of reality. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a skilled thief, specializes in stealing secrets through dreams. When offered a chance to erase his troubled past, he must implant an idea into someone’s subconscious — a process called "inception." With visually stunning effects, layered storytelling, and Hans Zimmer’s iconic score, the film delivers a surreal experience. The cast, including Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Marion Cotillard, shines, while the ambiguous ending sparks endless debates. It's a must-watch for fans of thought-provoking thrillers.

<dt><b>2.Parasite</b></dt>
<dd>Genre: Drama/Thriller
Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite is a darkly comedic, suspenseful tale that exposes class divides in modern society. The story follows the poor Kim family as they cleverly infiltrate the lives of the wealthy Park family, taking advantage of their naivety. Masterfully blending humor, horror, and tragedy, the film keeps viewers on edge as the narrative spirals into shocking chaos. The cinematography, symbolic storytelling, and stellar performances make this Oscar-winning film a work of art. It is a biting critique of social inequality and human nature, leaving a lasting impression.

Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel is a whimsical, visually enchanting tale that combines comedy with quirky charm. Set in a fictional European hotel during the 1930s, it follows Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes), a legendary concierge, and his loyal lobby boy, Zero, as they get entangled in a theft and murder mystery. The film is a visual feast, with Anderson’s signature symmetrical shots, rich color palette, and witty dialogue. Ralph Fiennes’ performance is both humorous and heartfelt, complemented by an ensemble cast. It’s a delightful, unique escape into Anderson’s eccentric universe.
